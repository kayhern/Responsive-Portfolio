            <p>My name is Kristen E. Hernandez and I am from New England. I have a degree in English with a concentration in Literature. I graduated from Westfield State University in 2011. I currently work as a project manager at a robotics company in Eastern Massachusetts. I am taking a coding boot camp course through Harvard Extension school to broaden my technical knowledge to help my current career and expand my options for further career development.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My interests include books, popular culture, music, art, travel and food. My favorite vacation I have ever been to is a cruise in the Caribbean. I love to learn about other cultures and am looking forward to a few vacations next year. The first vacation will be my third cruise in the Caribbean with my friends. My second vacation will be in Europe for my honeymoon. I am blessed and thankful for having the opportunities to travel, learn, and having a passion for self-improvement.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This is just a snapshot of who I am and what my interests are. As an aspiring web developer, I am open to meeting new people from other parts of the business. Please take a look at my portfolio. If you would like to learn more or have any questions, please contact me. Thank you!</p>
